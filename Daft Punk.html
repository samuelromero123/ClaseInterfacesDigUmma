        <b>Daft Punk</b> were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement; they also had success in the years
        following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, indie rock and pop. They are considered one of the most influential acts in dance music history. After Bangalter and de Homem-Christo's indie rock band Darlin' disbanded, they
        began experimenting with drum machines, synthesizers, and the talk box. Their debut studio album Homework was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk". From 1999, they assumed robot
        personas with helmets, outfits, and gloves for public appearances, and made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records. Daft Punk's second album, Discovery (2001), had further success,
        supported by hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". Their third album, Human After All (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United
        Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. They composed the score for the 2010 film Tron: Legacy. </p>

    <h2><b>Homework</b></h2>
    <h3><b><small>1993-1999</small></b></h3>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Homework is the debut studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 20 January 1997 by Virgin Records and Soma Quality Recordings. The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were
        intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good enough for an album. Homework's success brought worldwide attention to French house music. Homework charted in 14 different countries, peaking at number 3 on the
        French Albums Chart, number 150 on the United States Billboard 200 and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. By February 2001, the album had sold more than two million copies worldwide and received several gold and platinum certifications. Overall,
        Homework received positive critical response. The album features singles that had significant impact in French house and global dance music scenes, including the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play number-one singles "Da Funk" and "Around the World",
        the latter of which reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework_(Daft_Punk_album)">here</a>

    <h2><b>Discovery</b></h2>
    <h3><b><small>1999-2003</small></b></h3>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        In 1998, Daft Punk began recording their second album. The 2001 release of Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, surprising fans. The duo said that Discovery was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded
        attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. The album reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom, and its single, "One More Time",
        was a major club and mainstream hit. The song is heavily autotuned and compressed. Discovery created a new generation of Daft Punk fans. It also saw Daft Punk debut their distinctive robot costumes; they had previously worn Halloween masks or
        bags for promotional appearances. The singles "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" were also successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart. The song "Face to Face" hit No. 1 on the USA club play charts. A 45-minute
        excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded was released in 2001 as Alive 1997. Daft Punk commissioned Japanese animator Leiji Matsumoto to create Interstella 5555, a feature-length animation set to Discovery. The first four "episodes"
        were shown on Toonami in 2001, and the finished film was released on DVD in 2003. In December, Daft Punk released the remix album Daft Club. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(Daft_Punk_album)">here</a>

    <h2><b>Random Acces Memories</b></h2>
    <h3><b><small>2011-2015</small></b></h3>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        In 2011, Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track, "Drive", recorded while they were signed to Soma in the 1990s. The track was included in a twentieth anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2012, Daft
        Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show. Daft Punk recorded their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories, with musicians including Paul Williams, Chic
        frontman Nile Rodgers, and Giorgio Moroder. They left Virgin for Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label. The album was released on 21 May 2013. The lead single, "Get Lucky", became Daft Punk's first UK number-one single, and
        became the most-streamed new song in the history of Spotify. At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for their single "Lose Yourself to Dance," and presented the award for "Best Female Video" alongside Rodgers and Pharrell.
        In December, the duo revealed a music video for the song "Instant Crush", directed by Warren Fu and featuring Julian Casablancas. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Random Access Memories won the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of
        the Year and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while "Get Lucky" received the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. Daft Punk performed at the ceremony with Stevie Wonder, Rodgers, Williams as well as Random Access
        Memories rhythm section players Nathan East, Omar Hakim, Paul Jackson, Jr. and Chris Caswell. Daft Punk co-produced Kanye West's sixth studio album, Yeezus (2013), creating the tracks "On Sight," "Black Skinhead," "I Am a God," and "Send It Up".
        They provided additional vocals for Pharrel's 2014 single "Gust of Wind". On 10 March 2014, an unreleased Daft Punk song, "Computerized", leaked online; it features Jay Z and contains of "The Son of Flynn" from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, and
        was once intended to be a single promoting Tron: Legacy. In April 2015, Daft Punk appeared in a short tribute to Rodgers as part of a documentary on his life, Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk. Later in 2015, a documentary, Daft Punk Unchained,
        was released. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories">here</a>
